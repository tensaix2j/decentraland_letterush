description: The live player in a Decentraland scene. Use when the user wants to read player position or profile, fetch avatar appearance for off-scene addresses (parcel owners, NFT holders), trigger emotes, read equipped wearables, attach items to players/avatar (cosmetic vs held gameplay items), hide avatars or disable passports in zones (AvatarModifierArea), adjust locomotion speed, teleport the player (movePlayerTo), or listen for scene entry/exit. Do NOT use for NPC characters (see npcs), wallet/blockchain checks (see nft-blockchain), freezing player movement (see advanced-input for InputModifier), or camera mode (see camera-control).

# Player and Avatar System in Decentraland

## CRITICAL: The player Transform is READ-ONLY from scene code

`Transform` on `engine.PlayerEntity` is engine-controlled. **Mutations from scene code are silently ignored** — your code compiles, runs, no error is thrown, and nothing moves in-world. This is the most common bug when trying to lift, push, knock back, float, or teleport the player.

```typescript
// WRONG — compiles cleanly, runs, does NOTHING in-world
const t = Transform.getMutable(engine.PlayerEntity)
t.position.y += 0.1                      // ignored
t.position = Vector3.create(8, 0, 8)     // ignored
Transform.createOrReplace(engine.PlayerEntity, { ... }) // ignored
```

**Symptom to recognize:** TypeScript accepts the code, the system ticks, no console error, but the avatar never moves. If you wrote `Transform...PlayerEntity` and expected motion, this is your bug.

**Correct API by intent:**

| Goal | Use | Skill |
|------|-----|-------|
| Instant teleport / smooth slide to a point | `movePlayerTo` from `~system/RestrictedActions` | this skill, see below |
| Lift / float / launch / jump pad / knockback / push / wind / repulsion | `Physics.*` from `@dcl/sdk/ecs` | `player-physics` |
| Restrict / freeze movement | `InputModifier` on `engine.PlayerEntity` | `advanced-input` |
| Change run speed / jump height | `AvatarLocomotionSettings` on `engine.PlayerEntity` | this skill, see below |

`Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity)` is valid for **reading** position and rotation only.

## Player Position and Movement (Reading)

Access the player's position via the reserved `engine.PlayerEntity`:

```typescript
import { engine, Transform } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

function trackPlayer() {
	if (!Transform.has(engine.PlayerEntity)) return

	const playerTransform = Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity)
	console.log('Player position:', playerTransform.position)
	console.log('Player rotation:', playerTransform.rotation)
}

engine.addSystem(trackPlayer)
```

Always check `Transform.has(engine.PlayerEntity)` before reading player data — it may not be ready on the first frame.

### Distance-Based Logic

```typescript
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

function proximityCheck() {
	const playerPos = Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity).position
	const npcPos = Transform.get(npcEntity).position
	const distance = Vector3.distance(playerPos, npcPos)

	if (distance < 5) {
		console.log('Player is near the NPC')
	}
}

engine.addSystem(proximityCheck)
```

## Player Profile Data

Get the player's name, wallet address, and guest status:

```typescript
import { getPlayer } from '@dcl/sdk/src/players'

function main() {
	const player = getPlayer()
	if (player) {
		console.log('Name:', player.name)
		console.log('User ID:', player.userId)
		console.log('Is guest:', player.isGuest)
	}
}
```

- `userId` — the player's Ethereum wallet address (or guest ID)
- `isGuest` — `true` if the player hasn't connected a wallet

Check `isGuest` before attempting any wallet-dependent feature (guests have no on-chain identity).

## Profile Data for Off-Scene Users (Catalyst)

`getPlayer(userId)` only returns data for users **currently connected to this scene**. For any other address (parcel owner, NFT holder, leaderboard entry, off-scene claimant), fetch from the catalyst:

```
GET https://peer.decentraland.org/lambdas/profile/<wallet-address>
```

- Always use `peer.decentraland.org` — it is the canonical catalyst regardless of realm/world. Worlds servers do NOT expose `/lambdas`, so do not blindly read `realmInfo.baseUrl`.
- Response shape: `json.avatars[0].avatar.{ bodyShape, wearables, eyes:{color}, hair:{color}, skin:{color} }` (NOT the `json[0].metadata.avatars...` shape from older docs).
- Unknown address returns `{ avatars: [], timestamp: 0 }` — handle the empty array.
- Colors come as `{ r, g, b, a }` floats in `[0,1]`. Build a `Color3` and pass it directly to `AvatarShape.skinColor` / `hairColor` / `eyeColor` — these fields take a raw `Color3`, NOT `{ color: Color3 }` (wrapping causes TS2322).

`AvatarShape.create({ id: address })` with only an `id` does NOT auto-fetch wearables — the avatar renders undressed unless you supply `bodyShape`, `wearables`, and the color fields explicitly.

**Which API to use:**

- Local or in-scene player → `getPlayer(userId)` (sync, includes wearables/emotes).
- Off-scene address → `fetchAvatarFromCatalyst(address)` (async HTTP).

For the full helper (`fetchAvatarFromCatalyst`), end-to-end usage example, and gotchas, see `{baseDir}/references/catalyst-profile-fetch.md`.

## Avatar Attachments

Attach 3D objects to a player's avatar:

```typescript
import {
	engine,
	Transform,
	GltfContainer,
	AvatarAttach,
	AvatarAnchorPointType,
} from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const hat = engine.addEntity()
GltfContainer.create(hat, { src: 'models/hat.glb' })
Transform.create(hat, {})

// Attach to the local player's avatar
AvatarAttach.create(hat, {
	anchorPointId: AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_NAME_TAG,
})
```

`AvatarAttach` requires the target player to be in the same scene — attachments disappear when the player leaves.

> **Before picking `AvatarAttach`, decide whether the item is cosmetic or aim-critical.** Bone anchors inherit avatar skeleton animation (idle bob, walk cycle, gesture) — great for hats/backpacks/halos, **bad** for held weapons, aiming reticles, or anything where relative position must stay stable. See **Held items vs cosmetic items** below.

### Held items vs cosmetic items — `AvatarAttach` vs parenting to `engine.CameraEntity` / `engine.PlayerEntity`

SDK7 gives you three distinct mechanisms for "an entity that follows the player". They are not interchangeable — picking the wrong one is the single most common mistake when porting "held item" patterns from SDK6, and the most common subtle failure is parenting an aim-sensitive item (gun, reticle, flashlight) to `engine.PlayerEntity` and discovering the item does not track camera pitch when the player looks up or down.

**Default for any aim-sensitive held item: `Transform.parent = engine.CameraEntity`.** Use `engine.PlayerEntity` only when you specifically want yaw-only / no-pitch behavior (a body-fixed item the player carries but never aims with).

| Goal | Use | Tracks | Reason |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| **Aim-sensitive held item** — gun, aiming reticle, flashlight, anything pointed by looking around. **Recommended default for held gameplay items.** | `Transform.parent = engine.CameraEntity` (plus local position offset for "in front of and below" the camera) | Camera yaw **+ pitch** | Follows the camera's full transform, so the item points where the player is looking — including up/down. This is the SDK7 analogue of SDK6's `Attachable.FIRST_PERSON_CAMERA`. Aim stable (no animation jitter). |
| **Yaw-only / body-fixed item** — a held shield the player doesn't aim, a static torch, a fixed-position carry item that should stay level regardless of where the player looks. | `Transform.parent = engine.PlayerEntity` (plus local offset for hand-height / forward distance) | Player root: feet position + body **yaw only** (no pitch) | Follows the player's root transform. Stable (no animation), but stays level when the player looks up/down — wrong default for guns/aim items, correct for items meant to ride the body orientation only. |
| **Cosmetic item** — hat, halo, backpack, name plate, glow effect, torch visible to other players riding the avatar. | `AvatarAttach` with an `anchorPointId` (e.g. `AAPT_HEAD`, `AAPT_SPINE`, `AAPT_LEFT_HAND`) | The actual animated bone | Item moves naturally with idle bob, walk cycle, and gestures — visually correct for cosmetics attached to the body. **Not for aim** — animation jitter makes aim-sensitive items unusable. |

**Why `engine.CameraEntity` is the right default for aim-sensitive items:** `engine.PlayerEntity` only tracks the player's root (foot position + body yaw). Body yaw is NOT camera pitch — when the player tilts the camera up to aim at a flying target, the player root rotation does not change, so a gun parented to `PlayerEntity` stays flat and the muzzle doesn't track the look direction. Parenting to `engine.CameraEntity` inherits both yaw and pitch, so the gun aims where the camera looks. This matches the SDK6 `Attachable.FIRST_PERSON_CAMERA` behavior creators expect when porting.

**Why bone anchors break aim:** anchor points like `AAPT_RIGHT_HAND`, `AAPT_SPINE`, `AAPT_HEAD` are positions on the animated avatar skeleton. Every frame the engine pulls the bone's current world transform — which includes the procedural idle bob and any active animation clip. An entity parented there inherits all of that motion. For a weapon, this reads as jitter and makes aiming feel uncontrollable.

#### Example — gun held in first person (aim follows camera pitch)

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, GltfContainer, CameraModeArea, CameraType } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3, Quaternion } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const gun = engine.addEntity()
GltfContainer.create(gun, { src: 'assets/Models/blaster.glb' })
Transform.create(gun, {
	parent: engine.CameraEntity,           // gun follows camera (yaw + pitch) — aim tracks where you look
	position: Vector3.create(0.25, -0.2, 0.5), // right, down, forward of camera
	rotation: Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 0, 0),
	scale: Vector3.One(),
})
```

If the user does NOT want the item to track pitch (e.g. a held torch that should stay level, not point up when looking up), swap `engine.CameraEntity` for `engine.PlayerEntity`. **Do not pick `PlayerEntity` for a gun** — the result is a flat-pointing weapon that ignores look direction.

**Pair with `CameraModeArea` or a forced camera mode when equipping a held gun**, so the player is in first-person while aiming. See [[camera-control]].

#### Anti-pattern (what NOT to do for a held weapon)

```typescript
// WRONG — gun jitters with every idle/walk/gesture animation frame
AvatarAttach.create(gun, {
	anchorPointId: AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_HAND,
})
```

This **looks** like the right SDK7 way to "put a gun in the avatar's hand" because the API name reads that way — but the hand bone is animated, so the gun is unaimable in practice. Use parenting instead.

```typescript
// SUBTLY WRONG for a gun — looks correct in hip-fire, fails the moment the player aims up
Transform.create(gun, { parent: engine.PlayerEntity, position: ... })
```

`engine.PlayerEntity` inherits body yaw but NOT camera pitch. The gun stays flat when the player looks up to aim at a high target. Use `engine.CameraEntity` instead for any aim-sensitive item. `PlayerEntity` is correct only for body-fixed items that should stay level regardless of where the camera points (e.g. a carried lantern, a non-aimed shield).

#### SDK6 porting note

In SDK7 you have a choice that didn't exist in SDK6. SDK6's `Attachable.FIRST_PERSON_CAMERA` / `Attachable.AVATAR` mapped to coarse follow modes only. If you are porting a held item from an SDK6 scene that used `Attachable.FIRST_PERSON_CAMERA`, the SDK7 equivalent is **parenting to `engine.CameraEntity`** (NOT `AvatarAttach` to a hand anchor, and NOT `engine.PlayerEntity` — `PlayerEntity` loses camera pitch). See [[migrate-sdk6-to-sdk7]].

### Anchor Points

```typescript
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_NAME_TAG // Above the head
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_HAND // Right hand
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_HAND // Left hand
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_POSITION // [DEPRECATED] Avatar root position — protocol recommends parenting to `engine.PlayerEntity` (body-fixed) or `engine.CameraEntity` (aim-sensitive) instead
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_HEAD
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_NECK
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_SPINE
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_SPINE1
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_SPINE2
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_HIP
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_SHOULDER
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_ARM
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_FOREARM
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_HAND_INDEX
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_SHOULDER
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_ARM
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_FOREARM
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_HAND_INDEX
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_UP_LEG
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_LEG
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_FOOT
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_TOE_BASE
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_UP_LEG
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_LEG
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_FOOT
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_TOE_BASE
AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_NAME_TAG
```

**Anchor points inherit bone animation.** Bone-targeted anchors (`AAPT_RIGHT_HAND`, `AAPT_SPINE`, `AAPT_HEAD`, etc.) follow the **animated** skeleton — idle bob, walk cycle, and gesture animations all propagate to the attached entity. This is correct for cosmetic items (hats, halos, backpacks) and **wrong** for gameplay items where aim stability matters (guns, reticles). For aim-sensitive items parent to `engine.CameraEntity` (yaw + pitch — the default for guns/reticles/flashlights); for yaw-only body-fixed items parent to `engine.PlayerEntity`. See "Held items vs cosmetic items" above.

### Attach to a Specific Player

```typescript
AvatarAttach.create(hat, {
	avatarId: '0x123...abc', // Target player's wallet address
	anchorPointId: AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_RIGHT_HAND,
})
```

`avatarId` is the target player's wallet address. To attach to every player in the scene (including remote ones), iterate `engine.getEntitiesWith(PlayerIdentityData)` and read `player.address` for each — guard with a marker component so you attach only once per player:

```typescript
import { PlayerIdentityData } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

engine.addSystem(() => {
	for (const [entity, player] of engine.getEntitiesWith(PlayerIdentityData)) {
		// player.address is the wallet address to pass as avatarId
	}
})
```

To attach the **local** player's own held item, get the address from `getPlayer()` / `await getPlayer()` (`.userId`). Omitting `avatarId` attaches to the local player. For multiplayer visibility of a held/attached item, sync the anchor entity's `AvatarAttach` component (see [[multiplayer-sync]]).

## Triggering Emotes

### Default Emotes

```typescript
import { triggerEmote } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

// Play a built-in emote
triggerEmote({ predefinedEmote: 'robot' })
triggerEmote({ predefinedEmote: 'wave' })
triggerEmote({ predefinedEmote: 'clap' })
```

### Custom Scene Emotes

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL FILE NAMING REQUIREMENT:** The emote `.glb` file **MUST** end with `_emote.glb` (case-insensitive). This is **not** optional and **not** just a convention — the runtime rejects files that don't match this suffix.
>
> **Why this matters:** Scenes with incorrectly named emote files often **work fine in `npm run start` preview** but **silently fail in production** once deployed. Preview is more permissive; the deployed runtime is strict. Always rename the file on disk (e.g. `SnowballThrow.glb` → `SnowballThrow_emote.glb`) before deploying.
>
> Valid: `wave_emote.glb`, `Snowball_Throw_emote.glb`, `dance_EMOTE.GLB`
> Invalid: `wave.glb`, `emote_wave.glb`, `wave_emote_v2.glb`

```typescript
import { triggerSceneEmote } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

// File MUST end with _emote.glb — rename it on disk if it doesn't
triggerSceneEmote({
	src: 'animations/Snowball_Throw_emote.glb',
	loop: false,
})
```

**Notes:**

- Emotes play only while the player is standing still — walking or jumping interrupts them
- If you don't want a player to interrupt an emote, use the `InputModifier` component to freeze the player for the duration of the emote
- Both `triggerEmote` and `triggerSceneEmote` require the scene to declare the `ALLOW_TO_TRIGGER_AVATAR_EMOTE` permission in `scene.json` `requiredPermissions`.
- Both accept an optional `mask` (upper-body-only animation) — see "Emote masks" below.

### Stopping an emote

`stopEmote({})` from `~system/RestrictedActions` stops the local player's currently playing emote (built-in or scene emote). Useful to end a looping scene emote (`triggerSceneEmote({ src, loop: true })`) on demand — e.g. a "pick up / put down" toggle.

```typescript
import { stopEmote } from '~system/RestrictedActions'
stopEmote({})
```

### Emote masks (upper-body only)

`triggerEmote` and `triggerSceneEmote` both accept an optional `mask` (enum `AvatarMask`, imported from `@dcl/sdk/ecs`) that limits which bones the animation drives. Use it to restrict a looping emote to the upper body so the player can keep walking around while the upper body animates (e.g. carrying/juggling an object).

```typescript
import { AvatarMask } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { triggerSceneEmote } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

triggerSceneEmote({ src: 'animations/Carry_emote.glb', loop: true, mask: AvatarMask.AM_UPPER_BODY })
```

- Only value: `AvatarMask.AM_UPPER_BODY` (= 0). Omitting `mask` plays the full-body animation (the default) — there is no `AM_FULL_BODY` value in the enum.
- `mask` applies to `triggerEmote` and `triggerSceneEmote` only. `stopEmote({})` takes no arguments (`StopEmoteRequest` is empty).
- **Loop + mask interaction:** `loop: false` with `mask: AM_UPPER_BODY` plays the upper-body animation exactly once, then returns the upper body to locomotion. `loop: true` with the mask repeats until `stopEmote({})` is called. The loop flag is respected regardless of the mask. Verified against sdk7-test-scenes `88,-13-avatar-masks` and `80,-1-scene-emotes` (commit `1c0f394`).
- Verified against protocol `restricted_actions.proto` / `common/avatar_mask.proto` (pinned in `@dcl/sdk` via protocol `0010e70`) and sdk7-test-scenes `88,-13-avatar-masks` (2026-07-16). Earlier speculative names `AvatarEmoteMask` / `AEM_UPPER_BODY` / `AEM_FULL_BODY` were never released — do not use them.

## NPC Avatars

For creating NPCs (characters, shopkeepers, guards, etc.), see the **npcs** skill. It covers both the NPC Toolkit library (GLB-based, with dialogue and movement) and `AvatarShape`-based avatar NPCs.

## Avatar Modifier Areas

Modify how avatars appear or behave in a region.

```typescript
import {
	engine,
	Transform,
	AvatarModifierArea,
	AvatarModifierType,
} from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const modifierArea = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(modifierArea, {
	position: Vector3.create(8, 1.5, 8),
	scale: Vector3.create(4, 3, 4),
})

AvatarModifierArea.create(modifierArea, {
	area: Vector3.create(4, 3, 4),
	modifiers: [AvatarModifierType.AMT_HIDE_AVATARS],
	excludeIds: ['0x123...abc'], // Optional: exclude specific players
})
```

### Available Modifiers

```typescript
AvatarModifierType.AMT_HIDE_AVATARS // Hide all avatars in the area
AvatarModifierType.AMT_DISABLE_PASSPORTS // Disable clicking on avatars to see profiles
AvatarModifierType.AMT_HIDE_NAMETAGS // Hide the name tag above avatars in the area
```

`modifiers` is an array — combine several, e.g. `[AMT_HIDE_NAMETAGS, AMT_DISABLE_PASSPORTS]`. The `AvatarModifierArea` component takes both an `area: Vector3` field (the region size) AND the entity's `Transform.scale`; set both to the same size. `excludeIds` is an array of wallet addresses that stay unaffected (e.g. keep the scene owner visible); mutate it at runtime via `AvatarModifierArea.getMutable(entity).excludeIds = [...]`.

`AMT_HIDE_AVATARS` hides both avatars AND nametags — do not combine it with `AMT_HIDE_NAMETAGS` (redundant). Use `AMT_HIDE_NAMETAGS` only when you want nametags hidden while keeping avatars visible (e.g. stages, presentations, clean visual experiences). `AMT_HIDE_NAMETAGS` is combinable with `AMT_DISABLE_PASSPORTS`.

**Nametag hiding is head/torso based:** the nametag is hidden only while the player's head or torso is inside the area. If the area is too short, a player who double-jumps above it will have their nametag briefly reappear. Make the area tall enough to cover the expected range of movement.

## Avatar Locomotion Settings

Adjust the player's movement speed and jump height:

```typescript
import { engine, AvatarLocomotionSettings } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

// Modify run speed and jump height (set only the fields you want to change)
AvatarLocomotionSettings.createOrReplace(engine.PlayerEntity, {
	runSpeed: 14, // default is 10
	jumpHeight: 3, // default is 1
})
```

Fields (all `float`, optional) with client defaults — verified against unity-explorer `origin/main` `CharacterControllerSettings.asset`: `walkSpeed` (1.5), `jogSpeed` (8, the default movement speed), `runSpeed` (10), `jumpHeight` (1), `runJumpHeight` (1.5), `doubleJumpHeight` (2), `glidingSpeed` (6), `glidingFallingSpeed` (1), `hardLandingCooldown` (0.75s). See `references/avatar-apis.md`.

`glidingFallingSpeed` is a **max descent cap** — it limits how fast the player falls while gliding, but does not limit upward motion. While gliding, continuous scene forces are 1.5× stronger and can lift the player; see the `player-physics` skill ("Forces while gliding").

## Restrict Locomotion (InputModifier)

Use `InputModifier` on `engine.PlayerEntity` to freeze or selectively restrict the player's movement — useful for cutscenes, locked interactions, or controlled game mechanics.

```typescript
import { InputModifier, engine } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

// Freeze all movement
InputModifier.create(engine.PlayerEntity, {
	mode: InputModifier.Mode.Standard({ disableAll: true }),
})

// Remove restrictions
InputModifier.deleteFrom(engine.PlayerEntity)
```

**Behavior when frozen:** gravity and external forces still apply, camera rotation stays available, global input events are still detectable, restrictions lift automatically when the player leaves scene bounds.

**Standard-mode flags** (all boolean, on `InputModifier.Mode.Standard({...})`): `disableAll`, `disableWalk`, `disableJog`, `disableRun`, `disableJump`, `disableEmote`. Protocol also defines `disableDoubleJump` and `disableGliding`. Note `disableJog` is separate from `disableWalk`/`disableRun` — jog is the default movement speed, so disabling only walk+run still lets the player jog.

The `mode` can be built two equivalent ways — the `InputModifier.Mode.Standard({...})` helper, or the raw discriminated union `{ $case: 'standard', standard: {...} }`.

**Tip:** Combine with `triggerSceneEmote` — freeze the player during an animation, then remove InputModifier when it ends.

For the cutscene pattern, see the **advanced-input** skill.

## Teleporting the Player

**`movePlayerTo` from `~system/RestrictedActions` is the only way to relocate the player to a position.** Setting `Transform.getMutable(engine.PlayerEntity).position` does NOT work (see the read-only warning at the top of this file). For sustained forces (lift, knockback, push, wind), use the `player-physics` skill instead — `movePlayerTo` is for explicit teleports/slides, not for forces.

`movePlayerTo` accepts:

- `newRelativePosition` — where to move the player (scene-relative `Vector3`)
- `cameraTarget` _(optional)_ — a point in space for the camera to face after moving
- `avatarTarget` _(optional)_ — a point in space for the avatar to face after moving
- `duration` _(optional)_ — transition time in seconds; if provided, movement can be awaited

**Constraints:**

- The player must already be inside the scene's bounds for this to work
- The target position must also be within the scene's bounds
- During the transition the avatar passes through colliders (verified: a `CL_PHYSICS` obstacle placed in the path is passed through)
- Requires the `ALLOW_TO_MOVE_PLAYER_INSIDE_SCENE` permission in `scene.json` `requiredPermissions`
- All fields except `newRelativePosition` are optional — `cameraTarget` and `avatarTarget` may each be omitted or used independently
- The target Y may be elevated (e.g. `y: 12`) to place the player on a raised platform, not just ground level

### Instant teleport

```typescript
import { movePlayerTo } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

void movePlayerTo({
	newRelativePosition: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8),
	cameraTarget: Vector3.create(8, 1, 12),
	avatarTarget: Vector3.create(8, 1, 12),
})
```

### Smooth transition with duration

When `duration` is set, `movePlayerTo` is awaitable. The resolved value has a `success` boolean — `false` if the player interrupted the movement with input.

```typescript
import { movePlayerTo } from '~system/RestrictedActions'

async function teleport() {
	const result = await movePlayerTo({
		newRelativePosition: Vector3.create(1, 0, 1),
		cameraTarget: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8),
		duration: 2,
	})
	if (!result.success) {
		console.log('Movement was interrupted by the player')
	}
}
```

### Prevent the player from interrupting a transition

Combine `InputModifier` with `movePlayerTo` to lock movement for the duration:

```typescript
import { movePlayerTo } from '~system/RestrictedActions'
import { InputModifier, engine } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

async function lockedTeleport() {
	InputModifier.create(engine.PlayerEntity, {
		mode: InputModifier.Mode.Standard({ disableAll: true }),
	})

	await movePlayerTo({
		newRelativePosition: Vector3.create(1, 0, 1),
		cameraTarget: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8),
		duration: 2,
	})

	InputModifier.deleteFrom(engine.PlayerEntity)
}
```

### Avatar Change Listeners

React to avatar changes in real-time:

```typescript
import {
	AvatarEmoteCommand,
	AvatarBase,
	AvatarEquippedData,
} from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

// Detect when the Explorer reports an emote playing on a player.
// AvatarEmoteCommand is written BY THE EXPLORER to report emote playback
// TO the scene -- it is NOT a signal from scene to renderer. It is appended
// to every player entity (local and remote alike).
AvatarEmoteCommand.onChange(engine.PlayerEntity, (cmd) => {
	if (cmd) console.log('Emote played:', cmd.emoteUrn)
})

// Detect avatar appearance changes (wearables, skin color, etc.)
AvatarBase.onChange(engine.PlayerEntity, (base) => {
	if (base) console.log('Avatar name:', base.name)
})

// Detect equipment changes
AvatarEquippedData.onChange(engine.PlayerEntity, (equipped) => {
	if (equipped) console.log('Wearables changed:', equipped.wearableUrns)
})
```

### Additional Anchor Points

Beyond the commonly used anchor points, the full list includes:

- `AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_POSITION` — avatar feet position
- `AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_NAME_TAG` — above the name tag
- `AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_LEFT_HAND` / `AAPT_RIGHT_HAND`
- `AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_HEAD` — head bone
- `AvatarAnchorPointType.AAPT_NECK` — neck bone

## Example scenes

Engine-team test scenes (exercised against the real engine):

- [100,102-avatar-attach-test](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/100,102-avatar-attach-test) — `AvatarAttach` on multiple anchor points; enumerates every player via `PlayerIdentityData` and attaches to `player.address`; a follower entity reconstructs the attached world position from `PlayerEntity` + attached Transform.
- [80,-1-scene-emotes](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/80,-1-scene-emotes) — `triggerEmote`, `triggerSceneEmote` (with a deliberately mis-named non-`_emote.glb` file shown NOT playing), `stopEmote`, `mask: AvatarMask.AM_UPPER_BODY`, plus `loop: false` + mask (plays once, returns to locomotion) and `loop: true` + mask (repeats until stopped).
- [11,0-move-player-to-duration](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/11,0-move-player-to-duration) — `movePlayerTo` with `duration`, reading `result.success` via `.then()`, `InputModifier` locking input during the slide, and a `CL_PHYSICS` obstacle the avatar passes through mid-transition.
- [9,99-modifier-areas](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/9,99-modifier-areas) — `AvatarModifierArea` (`AMT_HIDE_AVATARS`) with runtime-mutated `excludeIds`, alongside `CameraModeArea`.
- [10,99-avatar-modifier-hide-nametags](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/10,99-avatar-modifier-hide-nametags) — `AvatarModifierArea` with `AMT_HIDE_NAMETAGS`: hides nametags while keeping avatars visible.
- [0,1-input-modifier](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/0,1-input-modifier) — `InputModifier` toggling every Standard flag (`disableAll/Walk/Jog/Run/Jump/Emote`), both via the helper and the raw `$case` form.
- [80,-4-restricted-actions](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/80,-4-restricted-actions) — `movePlayerTo` (incl. elevated `y`, `avatarTarget`-only turns), `triggerEmote`, `triggerSceneEmote`, `teleportTo`, `openExternalUrl`.
- [88,-13-avatar-masks](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/88,-13-avatar-masks) — emote masks: looping `AvatarMask.AM_UPPER_BODY` scene emote + `AvatarAttach` anchor to hold a synced crate, `stopEmote` to release. Also includes `loop: false` + mask pair (plays once then returns upper body to locomotion) and `loop: true` + mask pair (repeats until stopped) for verifying the masked-emote loop flag is respected.
