# Optimizing Decentraland Scenes

## Scene Limits (Per Parcel Count)

All limits scale with parcel count `n`. Triangles, entities, and bodies scale linearly. Materials, textures, and height scale logarithmically.

| Resource           | Formula         | 1 parcel | 2 parcels | 3 parcels | 4 parcels | 6 parcels | 9 parcels | 16 parcels | 20 parcels |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Triangles**      | n x 10,000      | 10,000   | 20,000    | 30,000    | 40,000    | 60,000    | 90,000    | 160,000    | 200,000    |
| **Entities**       | n x 200         | 200      | 400       | 600       | 800       | 1,200     | 1,800     | 3,200      | 4,000      |
| **Physics bodies** | n x 300         | 300      | 600       | 900       | 1,200     | 1,800     | 2,700     | 4,800      | 6,000      |
| **Materials**      | log2(n+1) x 20  | 20       | 31        | 40        | 46        | 56        | 66        | 81         | 87         |
| **Textures**       | log2(n+1) x 10  | 10       | 15        | 20        | 23        | 28        | 33        | 40         | 43         |
| **Height limit**   | log2(n+1) x 20m | 20m      | 31m       | 40m       | 46m       | 56m       | 66m       | 81m        | 87m        |

**File limits:** 15 MB per parcel, 300 MB max total, 200 files per parcel, 50 MB max per individual file.

File limits count only what is actually uploaded on deploy. Make sure `.dclignore` (at the project root) excludes all working files — Blender/FBX sources, draft models, concept art, spreadsheets, markdown docs — since these are often the bulk of a project's size and are never needed at runtime. See the `.dclignore` section in the **deploy-scene** skill.

Important: Except for the MB size limits, all other limits can be exceeded. It's generally not recommended to go over them because of performance impact, but if a user tests their scene and determines that it's good enough, it should be ok to publish.

## Entity Count Optimization

### Reuse Entities

Use this pattern only for cases where the scene should be spawning and removing instances dynamically.

```typescript
// BAD: Creating new entity each time
function spawnBullet() {
	const bullet = engine.addEntity() // Creates entity every call
	// ...
}

// GOOD: Object pooling
const bulletPool: Entity[] = []
function getBullet(): Entity {
	const existing = bulletPool.find((e) => !ActiveBullet.has(e))
	if (existing) return existing
	const newBullet = engine.addEntity()
	bulletPool.push(newBullet)
	return newBullet
}
```

### Remove Unused Entities

```typescript
engine.removeEntity(entity) // Frees the entity slot
```

### Use Parenting

Instead of independent transform values for each child, use entity hierarchy:

```typescript
const parent = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(parent, { position: Vector3.create(8, 0, 8) })

// Children inherit parent transform
const child1 = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(child1, { position: Vector3.create(0, 1, 0), parent })

const child2 = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(child2, { position: Vector3.create(1, 1, 0), parent })
```

## Triangle Count Optimization

### Use Lower-Poly Models

- Small props: 100-500 triangles
- Medium objects: 500-1,500 triangles
- Large buildings: 1,500-5,000 triangles
- Hero pieces: Up to 10,000 triangles

### Use LOD (Level of Detail)

Show simpler models at distance:

```typescript
engine.addSystem(() => {
	// Check distance to player and swap models
	const playerPos = Transform.get(engine.PlayerEntity).position
	const objPos = Transform.get(myEntity).position
	const distance = Vector3.distance(playerPos, objPos)

	const gltf = GltfContainer.getMutable(myEntity)
	if (distance > 30) {
		gltf.src = 'models/building_lod2.glb' // Low poly
	} else if (distance > 15) {
		gltf.src = 'models/building_lod1.glb' // Medium poly
	} else {
		gltf.src = 'models/building_lod0.glb' // High poly
	}
})
```

### Use Primitives Instead of Models

For simple shapes, `MeshRenderer` is lighter than loading a .glb:

```typescript
MeshRenderer.setBox(entity) // Very cheap
MeshRenderer.setSphere(entity) // Cheap
MeshRenderer.setPlane(entity) // Very cheap
```

## Texture Optimization

- **Dimensions must be power-of-two**: 256, 512, 1024
- **Maximum is 1024x1024.** The asset-bundle-converter enforces `DESKTOP_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE = 1024` (`AssetBundleConverter.cs` → `ReduceTextureSizeIfNeeded`): anything larger (e.g. 2048) is **downscaled to 1024 at conversion**, so authoring above 1024 wastes source size without visual benefit.
- **Recommended sizes**: 512x512 for most objects, 1024x1024 for hero pieces
- Use `.png` for UI/sprites with transparency
- Use `.jpg` for photos and textures without transparency
- Prefer compressed formats (WebP) over raw PNG where possible
- Use texture atlases (combine multiple textures into one image) to reduce draw calls and material count
- Share texture references across materials — do not duplicate texture files
- Reuse materials across entities:

```typescript
// GOOD: Define material once, apply to many
Material.setPbrMaterial(entity1, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({ src: 'images/wall.jpg' }),
})
Material.setPbrMaterial(entity2, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Common({ src: 'images/wall.jpg' }),
})
// Same texture URL = shared in memory
```

### Texture Size Guide by Use Case

| Use Case                      | Recommended | Maximum   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Scene objects (walls, floors) | 1024x1024   | 1024x1024 |
| Props and furniture           | 512x512     | 1024x1024 |
| UI elements / icons           | 256x256     | 512x512   |
| Skybox / environment maps     | 1024x1024   | 1024x1024 |

Textures do not need to be square — 512x1024 is valid as long as both dimensions are powers of two.

## Back-Face Culling

Back-face culling skips rendering the inside face of any polygon the player will never see from behind. It's set in your 3D modeling tool (Blender, Maya, etc.) — **not** in SDK code.

**Rule of thumb:** Enable back-face culling on all materials by default. Only disable it when a surface must be visible from both sides (e.g., a leaf plane on a tree, a thin wall).

## System Optimization

### Avoid Per-Frame Allocations

```typescript
// BAD: Creates new Vector3 every frame
engine.addSystem(() => {
	const target = Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) // Allocation!
})

// GOOD: Reuse constants
const TARGET = Vector3.create(8, 1, 8)
engine.addSystem(() => {
	// Use TARGET
})
```

### Throttle Expensive Operations

```typescript
let lastCheck = 0
engine.addSystem((dt) => {
	lastCheck += dt
	if (lastCheck < 0.5) return // Only run every 0.5 seconds
	lastCheck = 0
	// Expensive operation here
})
```

### Remove Systems When Not Needed

```typescript
const systemFn = (dt: number) => {
	/* ... */
}
engine.addSystem(systemFn)

// When no longer needed:
engine.removeSystem(systemFn)
```

## Asset Preloading (AssetLoad Component)

Use `AssetLoad` to pre-load assets into memory ahead of time so they display instantly when needed. `PBAssetLoad` has a single field: `assets: string[]` — the list of asset paths to load. Commonly created on `engine.RootEntity`, but any entity works.

```typescript
import {
	engine,
	AssetLoad,
	assetLoadLoadingStateSystem,
	LoadingState,
} from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

// Queue assets to pre-load (any entity works — commonly a dedicated cube/root).
// AssetLoad.getOrCreateMutable lets you also PUSH more paths later:
//   AssetLoad.getOrCreateMutable(entity, { assets: [...] }).assets.push(morePath)
AssetLoad.create(entity, { assets: ['models/big.glb', 'sounds/win.mp3'] })

// React to loading state. The callback fires PER ASSET (once per path in the
// list), receiving { asset, currentState } — NOT one batch-level event.
assetLoadLoadingStateSystem.registerAssetLoadLoadingStateEntity(
	entity,
	(state: { asset: string; currentState: LoadingState }) => {
		if (state.currentState === LoadingState.FINISHED) {
			// state.asset finished loading and is now cached
		}
	},
)
// Stop listening: assetLoadLoadingStateSystem.removeAssetLoadLoadingStateEntity(entity)
```

`LoadingState` enum members: `LOADING`, `FINISHED`, `FINISHED_WITH_ERROR` (asset found but failed to load), `NOT_FOUND` (path does not exist), `UNKNOWN` (initial/default state). A missing/typo'd `src` resolves to `NOT_FOUND`, not a thrown error.

Caveats:

- The state callback is **per-asset**, keyed by the `asset` path string — dispatch on `state.asset` to update the right entity. There is no single "all finished" event; track completion yourself by counting per-asset `FINISHED`/error states.
- `AssetLoad` only **adds** assets to memory. Removing a path from the `assets` list does **not** free memory — there is no unload via `AssetLoad`.
- Preloading a path does **not** create/render anything — you still `getOrCreateMutable` the real component (`GltfContainer`, `AudioSource`, `VideoPlayer`, `Material` texture) on an entity to use it; the preload just makes that later use instant.
- If an asset is used immediately at scene startup, there is **no need** for `AssetLoad`. Only pre-load assets NOT required at startup — things that appear later or on player interaction.

## Loading Time Optimization

- Use CDN URLs for large shared assets when possible

### Loading Areas for Large Scenes

For scenes with many 3D models (e.g. a furnished multi-room building), avoid rendering everything at once. Use trigger areas to load and unload content as the player moves through the scene:

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, GltfContainer, TriggerArea, triggerAreaEventsSystem, ColliderLayer } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

// Keep furniture hidden initially
let furnitureLoaded = false

// When player enters the building, spawn interior furniture
const trigger = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(trigger, {
  position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8),
  scale: Vector3.create(3, 3, 3)
})
TriggerArea.setBox(trigger, ColliderLayer.CL_PLAYER)

triggerAreaEventsSystem.onTriggerEnter(trigger, () => {
  if (!furnitureLoaded) loadInterior()
  furnitureLoaded = true
})
triggerAreaEventsSystem.onTriggerExit(trigger, () => {
  if (furnitureLoaded) unloadInterior()
  furnitureLoaded = false
})
```

This pattern keeps the initial triangle and entity counts low and loads detail only when needed.

## Common Performance Pitfalls

| Pitfall                              | Symptom                          | Fix                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too many unique materials            | High draw calls, low FPS         | Merge into texture atlases, reuse materials              |
| Non-power-of-two textures            | Memory bloat, visual artifacts   | Resize all textures to 256/512/1024 (1024 max)          |
| Creating/destroying entities rapidly | Frame stutters                   | Use entity pooling                                       |
| Heavy computation every frame        | Consistent low FPS               | Add timer guards, reduce frequency                       |
| Unused colliders on decorations      | Physics body limit exceeded      | Remove MeshCollider from non-interactive objects         |
| Large uncompressed textures          | Slow loading, file size exceeded | Use WebP, reduce resolution, use atlases                 |
| Working files uploaded on deploy     | "Scene too large" deploy error   | Add Blender/FBX sources, concept art, docs to `.dclignore` (see **deploy-scene**) |
| Too many transparent materials       | Extra draw calls, sorting issues | Minimize transparency, use alpha cutoff instead of blend |
| Adding entities/components in a system without guards | Entity count explodes | Systems run every frame — always check before creating  |
| Unbounded entity queries             | CPU spike                        | Filter with specific components, cache results           |
| All detail loaded at all distances   | Triangle budget blown            | Implement LOD system                                     |
| No asset preloading                  | Pop-in during gameplay           | Use AssetLoad to preload assets needed later (not startup assets) |

## Scene Statistics Monitoring

### In Preview Mode

When running the scene locally with `npm run start`:

- Press **P** to toggle the performance panel.
- Monitor: FPS, draw calls, triangles, entities, materials, textures, memory.
- Scene limits are shown alongside current usage with green/yellow/red indicators.

### What to Watch

- **FPS below 30**: Something is too expensive. Check draw calls and system execution time.
- **Triangle count approaching limit**: Enable LOD, reduce model detail, remove hidden faces.
- **Entity count climbing**: Likely a leak — entities being created but never destroyed. Implement pooling.
- **Draw calls above 300 (1 parcel)**: Too many materials. Merge, atlas, and reduce transparency.

## Example scenes

Engine-team stress-test scenes (treat as ground truth for API shape):

- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/0,2-cube-wave-32x32 — ~961 primitive cubes in ONE parcel (far over the 200-entity soft limit), all `Transform.position.y` mutated every frame via a single `engine.getEntitiesWith(MeshRenderer)` query. Demonstrates that soft limits can be exceeded and that a per-frame query over hundreds of entities is the intended pattern (no pooling needed for a fixed static set — cubes are created once in `main()`, not per frame).
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/73,-2-dbmonster — UI stress test: dozens of nested `<Label>` in a ReactEcs tree rebuilt every frame with `Math.random()` values. Demonstrates the UI render function re-runs each frame, so heavy per-frame allocation in `.tsx` is a real cost.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/88,-12-asset-load — `AssetLoad` preloading with the per-asset `assetLoadLoadingStateSystem` state callback (mp3 / texture / video / glb, plus a deliberately missing path that resolves to `NOT_FOUND`).
